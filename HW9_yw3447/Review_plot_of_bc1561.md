![Alt text](screenshots/hiv_race.png)
**Plot of reported AIDS cases in the US (1981 - 2012)**

**Review:**

- Clarity

The plot is quite clear and easy to read. It is not difficult to understand the core idea to be expressed.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**
It would be great to add a title in legend frame in order to indicate that the different color of lines represents the different race.


- Aesthetic

This is a simple plot and the five lines prefectly show the trend of AIDS cases in US. Basically, the color of five lines are chosed properly.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**
It would be better to use two more different colors(like green and red) for "Asian" and "Native American". Also, the font size of label and title can be a little bit bigger.

Hispanic and Asians are indistinguishable for clor blind people, and so are Black and Native American lines

- Honesty

The plot seems to show the real trend of AIDS cases among different races and there is no obvious outliers or errors.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**
However it would be better to add the source of data or show the process of data cleaning in order to verify the plot.

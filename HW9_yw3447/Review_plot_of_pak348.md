![Alt text](screenshots/water.png)

**Review:**

- Clarity

The plot is quite clear and easy to read. The label and limitation of X and Y axses are good.


- Aesthetic

This is a simple plot and the only information conveyed is the water consumption per capita. Bar plot is a good choice to show the consumption for each year.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**
One alternative suggestion is, it's better to add one broken line to show the trend of the decreasing consumption.

- Honesty

The plot seems to show the real data honestly and there is no obvious outliers or errors. 

**IMPROVEMENTS:**
However it would be better to add the source of data and show the process of data cleaning in order to verify the plot.
